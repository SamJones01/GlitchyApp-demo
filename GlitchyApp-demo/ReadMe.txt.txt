IF YOU CAN'T GET IT TO WORK GIVE ME A SHOUT

Rules
-----
- You have 25 minutes to find as many bugs as possible
- Every bug you find must be written down in a certain layout (See
  below for details) and I shall examine it after
- I have a list of known bugs
- There may be some bugs that I have not found
- Each bug has a scaled rating depending on how difficult it is to
  find
- The harder to find or the more serious the more points it is worth
- The person with the most points at the end of 25 minutes is the
  winner and shall be given a prize!

Advice
------
- Reload the app after you find a bug - it is a very glitchy app
  and during testing I found bugs that infact were caused by previous
  bugs. Don't get into that cycle like I did
  HINT : not fun...
- If you think it is a bug list it - what have you to lose?

Layout
------
Your report of each bug should look like this...

BUG : (Describe the bug)
EXAMPLE : (Provide a tutorial on how you got the bug to occur)
SEVERITY : (This is your own judgement - it is rated in a scale of
	    1 to 5. 5 is very severe as it interferes with the users
	    ability to use the system. 1 is little issue as it will
            not interferes with the user but may cause minor 
	    annoyance or frustration)

The report can be written by hand or in a text editor.

GOOD LUCK and HAPPY HUNTING!
